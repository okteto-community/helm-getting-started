# Getting Started on Okteto with Helm

This example shows how to use [Okteto](https://okteto.com) to deploy and develop a sample application that uses a Helm chart.

The instructions below you already have a running instance of Okteto. For more information on this, [visit our docs](https://www.okteto.com/docs).

# Deploy your Development Environment

Install the Okteto CLI and configure access to Okteto:

```
okteto context use https://okteto.example.com
```

In order to deploy your application in Kubernetes, run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/okteto-community/helm-getting-started # or clone your own fork
cd helm-getting-started
okteto deploy
```

Once the application is deployed, you can access it via the public endpoints generated by Okteto:

```
okteto endpoints
```

# Iterate on your Helm chart

Every time you run `okteto deploy`, Okteto will automatically build the container image defined in the `okteto.yaml` file, and redeploy your application. Use this to quickly iterate on your helm chart and your Dockerfile.
